# Google IT Support Labs

“This repo started as my hands-on lab notebook from the Google IT Support Certificate, but I’ve expanded it with my own real-world troubleshooting scenarios, ticket simulations, and security labs.”

## Contents

- Troubleshooting exercises covering Windows and network issues  
- Ticket triage and incident handling simulations  
- Security basics and best practices labs  
- Study notes, tips, and summaries  

This is a work in progress — more labs and notes will be added regularly!
